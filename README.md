 Board: A0- Potentiometru
        7- Switch
        6- LED_3
        5- LED_2
        3- LED_1
        13- LED_13(on Arduino board)
Program wich use a scheduler function to implemet a   non- preemtive  Real time sistem, it have 6 tasks

Task_1:  read teh potentiometer value and displait on sErial Monitor   

Task_2: Turn ON LED3 || LED2 function of POTENTIOMETER value

Task_3: Is using a swich statemant with 3 cases

Task4: Is setting the duty cicle for an led reading a value on serial interface UART 0- 99%

Task5:  Read the switch button status: if button pressed LED 13 from Arduino board is blinking   

Task6: Count how many times a task was executed
